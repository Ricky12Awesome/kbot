# KBot

A Discord Bot that is being made 
in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
using [JavaCord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) as the Discord API
and [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) as the SQL Library.

I'm making this for the fun of it. It's pretty much does what every other bot does. 

This bot is going to be very configurable as well.

# Commands
- `test` - A test command to test stuff
- `help` - Gives help about a command
- `info` - Gives info about the bot
- `purge` - Deletes messages
