# KBot

A Discord Bot that is being made 
in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
using [JavaCord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) as the Discord API
and [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) as the SQL Library.

I'm making this for the fun of it. It's pretty much does what every other bot does. 

This bot is going to be very configurable as well.
